# Riot Games - Frontend Engineer Test
*Thank you for the opportunity. It was a pleasure to meet with you.

## What I Used
*Vanilla Javascript ES6
*Jquery in some places
*Got some tips for Ajax get request. Because mostly using `fetch` or `axios`

## Tested Devices
*1920x1080 Desktop
*Iphone X, Iphone 6/7/8, Samsung Galaxy S9, Huawei Mate 10 Pro

## How could be improved?
*Without using `Jquery`, it can be faster.
*For styling `scss` or `stylus` may be more organized.
*If I have a chance to choose a library for styling, and building the app in `React` I prefer `Styled Components`
