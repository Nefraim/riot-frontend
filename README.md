# Riot Games - Frontend Engineer Test
*Thank you for the opportunity. It was a pleasure to meet with you.<br>
<br>
## What I Used
*Vanilla Javascript ES6<br>
*Jquery in some places<br>
*Got some tips for Ajax get request. Because mostly using `fetch` or `axios`<br>
<br>
## Tested Devices
*1920x1080 Desktop<br>
*Iphone X, Iphone 6/7/8, Samsung Galaxy S9, Huawei Mate 10 Pro<br>

## How could be improved?
*Without using `Jquery`, it can be faster.<br>
*For styling `scss` or `stylus` may be more organized.<br>
*If I have a chance to choose a library for styling, and building the app in `React` I prefer `Styled Components`<br>
